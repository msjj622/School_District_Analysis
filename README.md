# School District Analysis
## Overview of school district analysis:
The purpose of school District analysis is to replace the math and reading scores for 9th graders at Thomas High School where the school board found out that this school has been shown academic dishonesty, specifically reading and math scores for 9th graders. Therefore, the school board wants to uphold state-testing standards and have asked for help.

Based on the request from the school board, I recalculated the total student count excepting 9th grade students in Thomas High School, the percentages of passing math and reading and the overall passing percentage with the recalculated total student count.

By using 'loc' method with conditional statements, comparison and logical operators, I can replace current scores of the math and reading for 9th graders at Thomas High School to NaN which we can input new scores later on.
